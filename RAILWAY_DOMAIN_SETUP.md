# Railway Custom Domain Setup üåê

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Deploy Your App to Railway (If Not Done Yet)

1. Go to **railway.app** and sign up/login
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Select your repository or give Railway access to connect it
5. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python/Flask app
6. It will build and deploy automatically! ‚ú®

### Step 2: Add Your Environment Variables

1. In your Railway project, click **"Variables"** tab
2. Click **"New Variable"** and add each one from your `.env` file:
   - `SECRET_KEY=1bdfd2bf1dc5103bb3e08fff623481ddbf32a00b831f87584c56b56d3f31b894`
   - `DEBUG=False`
   - `ADMIN_API_KEY=13883b925f2be1d1acf330dc0f3e0e470024fb20019eb26eb0e6e59c9ea9dfe6`
3. Add any other variables you need (Twitter API keys, etc.)

### Step 3: Add Your Custom Domain

1. In Railway, go to your **project settings**
2. Click on **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Networking"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Custom Domains"** section
4. Click **"Add Domain"** or **"Custom Domain"**
5. Enter your domain:
   - Example: `pointslotto.com` or `www.pointslotto.com`
   - Or both (you can add multiple domains)

### Step 4: Configure Your DNS

Railway will show you DNS instructions. You have two options:

#### Option A: CNAME Method (Easiest - Use This!)

1. Railway gives you a target like: `xxxx.up.railway.app` or `xxxx.railway.app`

2. Go to your domain registrar (where you bought the domain):
   - **GoDaddy**: DNS Management
   - **Namecheap**: Advanced DNS
   - **Cloudflare**: DNS Records
   - **Google Domains**: DNS Settings

3. Add a CNAME record:
   - **Type**: CNAME
   - **Name/Host**: `www` (for www.yourdomain.com)
   - **Value/Target**: `xxxx.railway.app` (Railway's provided URL)
   - **TTL**: 3600 (or Auto)

4. For root domain (yourdomain.com without www):
   - Some providers support CNAME on root, but most need:
   - **Type**: A record pointing to Railway's IP (they'll provide it)

#### Option B: A Record Method

If Railway provides an IP address:
- **Type**: A
- **Name/Host**: `@` (for root domain) or leave blank
- **Value**: Railway's IP address
- **TTL**: 3600

### Step 5: Wait for DNS Propagation

- DNS changes take **5 minutes to 48 hours** (usually 15-60 minutes)
- Railway will show a status: "Pending" ‚Üí "Active" ‚Üí "Live"
- SSL certificate is **automatic** once DNS is verified! üîí

### Step 6: Verify It's Working

1. Check Railway dashboard - domain should show "Active" or "Live"
2. Visit your domain in browser
3. You should see your app, and the lock icon (üîí) means SSL is working!

## Common DNS Providers Setup

### GoDaddy:
1. Go to **My Products** ‚Üí Click on your domain ‚Üí **DNS**
2. Add Record:
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Name: `www`
   - Value: Railway's target URL
   - TTL: 600 seconds

### Namecheap:
1. **Domain List** ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí **Advanced DNS**
2. Add New Record:
   - Type: `CNAME Record`
   - Host: `www`
   - Value: Railway's target URL
   - TTL: Automatic

### Cloudflare:
1. Go to your domain ‚Üí **DNS** ‚Üí **Records**
2. Add Record:
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Name: `www`
   - Target: Railway's target URL
   - Proxy status: DNS only (orange cloud OFF) initially
   - Then turn on proxy (orange cloud ON) for Cloudflare protection

### Google Domains:
1. **DNS** ‚Üí **Custom resource records**
2. Add:
   - Name: `www`
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Data: Railway's target URL
   - TTL: 3600

## Troubleshooting

**Domain shows "Pending" for a long time?**
- Check DNS records are correct
- Use `nslookup yourdomain.com` to verify DNS propagation
- Make sure TTL is set correctly (don't use 0)

**SSL certificate not working?**
- Railway handles this automatically
- Wait 10-15 minutes after DNS is active
- Try accessing via https:// (Railway forces HTTPS)

**App not loading?**
- Check Railway logs in the dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set
- Make sure app is running (green status in Railway)

## Your Railway URL vs Custom Domain

- **Railway URL**: `your-project.railway.app` (free, works immediately)
- **Custom Domain**: `yourdomain.com` (needs DNS setup, but it's yours!)

Both can work at the same time - users can access via either URL!

## Summary

1. ‚úÖ Deploy app to Railway
2. ‚úÖ Add environment variables
3. ‚úÖ Add custom domain in Railway settings
4. ‚úÖ Update DNS records at your domain registrar
5. ‚úÖ Wait for DNS propagation (15-60 min usually)
6. ‚úÖ SSL certificate auto-generates
7. ‚úÖ Done! Your app is live on your domain! üéâ
